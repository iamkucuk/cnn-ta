    """
    Finds the peaks and valleys of a series of HLC (open is not necessary).
    TR: This is modified peak_valley_pivots function in order to find peaks and valleys for OHLC.
    Parameters
    ----------
    close : This is series with closes prices.
    high : This is series with highs  prices.
    low : This is series with lows prices.
    up_thresh : The minimum relative change necessary to define a peak.
    down_thesh : The minimum relative change necessary to define a valley.
    Returns
    -------
    an array with 0 indicating no pivot and -1 and 1 indicating valley and peak
    respectively
    Using Pandas
    ------------
    For the most part, close, high and low may be a pandas series. However, the index must
    either be [0,n) or a DateTimeIndex. Why? This function does X[t] to access
    each element where t is in [0,n).
    The First and Last Elements
    ---------------------------
    The first and last elements are guaranteed to be annotated as peak or
    valley even if the segments formed do not have the necessary relative
    changes. This is a tradeoff between technical correctness and the
    propensity to make mistakes in data analysis. The possible mistake is
    ignoring data outside the fully realized segments, which may bias analysis.
